### Picture-Perfect is a photo sharing app for different photographers from different states. This is app is designed to connect photographers from across the US. 

### How it works: Select  the photographers tab and you'll see a list of users. At the bottom of the page there's a create new user button for you to add yourself as a user. You can also select on each user and edit,update, and delete users. How cool is that! Select the location tab and it'll take you to a list of locations with photos associated with it's particular location. Select the photos tab and see all the photos.
